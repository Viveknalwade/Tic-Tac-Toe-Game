# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
   Tic‑Tac‑Toe is a classic two‑player strategy game played on a 3 × 3 grid. Each player chooses a symbol—traditionally “X” or “O”—and takes turns marking an empty cell. The goal is to be the first to place three of your symbols in a straight line, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
